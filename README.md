# Cisco-Packet-Tracer
In the diverse and complex scenarios presented by Cisco Packet Tracer, I have honed my skills in creating and managing simulated network environments. This includes the configuration and operation of switches and routers, as well as the physical connection of devices.

I meticulously check each connection to ensure its proper functioning and deploy Command Line Interface (CLI) commands for network configuration and troubleshooting. This hands-on experience has provided me with a deep understanding of network fundamentals and the intricacies of network protocols.

Furthermore, I have gained proficiency in designing and implementing network topologies, troubleshooting network issues, and understanding the impact of different network configurations. This practical knowledge, coupled with theoretical understanding, makes me adept at handling real-world network scenarios.

This repository contains a collection of my work and demonstrations using Cisco Packet Tracer, showcasing my ability to handle various network scenarios and configurations. I hope it serves as a valuable resource for those interested in network simulation and management.
